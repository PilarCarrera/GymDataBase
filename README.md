# GymDataBase
This project in SQL was a group project in the class “Bases de Datos” at the University of Cantabria on my second year. My colleges were: Irene Zamanillo, Sergio Diaz and Juan José Cobo.
The Data base consist on describing a gym, with members and activities. These activities would have a timetable with a room assigned to it, a discount for being gold member, the professors in the gym, which activity does he teach, the members of the gym with their type. This Data Base calculates the specific money each client must pay for the gym and the extra money for each activity they are in.
